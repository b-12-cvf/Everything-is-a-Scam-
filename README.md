## 🛡️ The Mission
**Everything Is A Scam** is a decentralized, community-driven initiative to index, categorize, and expose internet fraud. We focus on:
- Crypto Rug Pulls & Honey Pots
- Fake "Guru" Courses
- Malicious Developers & Influencers
- Predatory VIP Telegram/Discord Groups

This repository hosts the **frontend interface** for our public database.

- **Token Contract (SOL):** `[Your_CA_Here]`

## ⚙️ How It Works
The EIAS ecosystem operates on a **Verify-then-Publish** model:
1.  **Report:** Users submit evidence (Tx hashes, screenshots, logs) via Discord.
2.  **Verify:** Moderators & Community Analysts validate the claim against blockchain data.
3.  **Publish:** Verified bad actors are added to the Global Blacklist.

## 💰 Funding & Transparency
We are building a sustainable ecosystem that does **not** rely on selling tokens to survive.

* **Revenue Stream:** We utilize the **0.95% Creator Fee** provided by the Pump.fun protocol for micro-cap tokens.
* **0% Dev Dump Policy:** The development team does not need to sell the token supply to pay for servers or moderators. The trading volume itself funds the fight against scammers.
* **Usage:** 100% of these protocol fees go toward:
    * Server Maintenance (VPS/Hosting).
    * Moderator Compensation.
    * Development of automated scanning bots.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, TailwindCSS (CDN)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
- **Database (Backend):** Discord Interaction API + JSON (Connected via Bot)
